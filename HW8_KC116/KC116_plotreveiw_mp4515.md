## CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

The clarity of the plot is pretty good. The color code is pretty well differentiating the male. vs female but the colors could be changed . The plot is well and concise. 

## AESTHETIC: 

The colors are aesthetically fine but not the best for blind people to see. Blue for men and pink for women could be changed. The title clearly defines accidental deaths per gender and thus is clear and aesthetically moderate. 

## HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

The data is although produced with reproducing data but the data could be deformed as it is not normalized. It could give a wrong indication for each sex within the set.
